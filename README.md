I added three different tools so I could manage my posts directly on my blog: a search tool, a create tool, and a delete tool. Here are some techniques Iâ€™ve used to accomplish this using PHP and SQL: Dynamic Query Filters: based on user inputs, I dynamically append conditions to the SQL query allowing for customizable search. Input handling and validation: checking for presence and non-emptiness of parameters before appending to SQL query. Pagination: calculating total results, results per page, and other pagination logic to ensure users can navigate through pages of results Password Hashing: for creating and deleting posts, I use a hashed password check for security and to authenticate actions.
